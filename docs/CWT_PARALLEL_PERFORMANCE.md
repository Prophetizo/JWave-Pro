# CWT Parallel Performance Optimization

## Overview

The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) implementation in JWave now includes parallel processing capabilities that provide significant performance improvements while maintaining mathematical correctness.

## Performance Results

### Direct Transform Method
- **Sequential time**: 11,178 ms
- **Parallel time**: 1,784 ms  
- **Speedup**: 6.26x
- **Efficiency**: 62.6% (on 10-core system)

### FFT-based Transform Method
- **Sequential time**: 22.14 ms
- **Parallel time**: 8.12 ms
- **Speedup**: 2.73x
- **Efficiency**: 27.3% (on 10-core system)

### Scalability
The parallel implementation shows excellent scalability:
- 10 scales: 4.22x speedup
- 25 scales: 6.60x speedup
- 50 scales: 6.61x speedup
- 100 scales: 6.48x speedup

## Usage

### Basic Parallel Transform
```java
ContinuousWaveletTransform cwt = new ContinuousWaveletTransform(new MorletWavelet(1.0, 1.0));
double[] signal = // your signal
double[] scales = ContinuousWaveletTransform.generateLogScales(1, 100, 50);
double samplingRate = 1000.0;

// Parallel direct transform
CWTResult result = cwt.transformParallel(signal, scales, samplingRate);

// Parallel FFT-based transform (faster for long signals)
CWTResult resultFFT = cwt.transformFFTParallel(signal, scales, samplingRate);
```

### Custom Parallelism Level
```java
// Use custom thread pool with 4 threads
CWTResult result = cwt.transformParallelCustom(signal, scales, samplingRate, 4);
```

## Implementation Details

### Parallelization Strategy
- Parallelizes across scales (embarrassingly parallel)
- Each scale computation is independent
- Uses Java parallel streams for simplicity
- Automatic threshold detection based on signal and scale count

### Thread Safety
- All parallel methods are thread-safe
- Multiple transforms can run concurrently
- No shared mutable state between scale computations

### Automatic Thresholds
The implementation automatically falls back to sequential processing for small problems:
- Signals < 64 samples: Always sequential
- Signals 64-256 samples: Parallel if ≥16 scales
- Signals > 256 samples: Parallel if ≥8 scales

## Correctness Guarantees

1. **Numerical Accuracy**: Parallel results are identical to sequential (within machine epsilon)
2. **Thread Safety**: Verified through concurrent execution tests
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Original methods unchanged, new parallel methods added

## Recommendations

1. **Use parallel methods for**:
   - Large signals (>1000 samples)
   - Many scales (>10)
   - Real-time processing with multi-core systems

2. **Use sequential methods for**:
   - Small signals (<100 samples)
   - Few scales (<8)
   - Single-threaded environments

3. **FFT vs Direct**:
   - Use FFT-based methods for signals >1000 samples
   - Direct method may be faster for very small effective wavelet support

## Future Optimizations

1. **GPU acceleration** for massive scale counts
2. **SIMD vectorization** for inner loops
3. **Memory pooling** to reduce allocation overhead
4. **Cache-aware tiling** for very large signals
